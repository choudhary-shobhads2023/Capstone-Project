## Capstone-Project
## Title - Customer Churn Prediction Analysis

## Problem Statement:
An E Commerce company or DTH (we can choose either of these two domains) provider is facing a lot of competition in the current market and it has become a challenge to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the company wants to develop a model through which they can do churn prediction of the accounts and provide segmented offers to the potential churners. In this company, account churn is a major thing because 1 account can have multiple customers. hence by losing one account the company might be losing more than one customer. We have been assigned to develop a churn prediction model for this company and provide business recommendations on the campaign.

## Objective: 
* Here the objective is to Build a Model to identify the Customers who will potentially Churn and provide useful business recommendations. Retaining a loyal customer is far more 
  important than acquiring a new one. Hence predictive analysis of customer Retention is absolutely necessary in all business.
* The Goal of this project is to predict the type of customers that has the potential to churn by identifying various features available that can help in minimizing the customers 
  churn rates and get the right business insights.

## Solutions Approach:
   * Visual inspection of data (rows, columns, descriptive details).
   * Understanding of attributes (variable info, renaming if required).
   * Exploratory data analysis - Univariate , Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis using Proper Graphs/Charts, Missing Value treatment, Outlier treatment, Feature Selection etc..
   * Generate Useful Business insights from EDA.
   * Performed Clustering and Segmentation and Drawn some Useful Business insights using Clustering & Segmentation.
   * Build various models and Tested predictive model against the test set using various appropriate performance metrics.
   * Performed Hyperparameter Tuning wherever Required.
   * Interpretation of the most optimum model and its implication on the business.
   * Recommendations.

## Inferences:
   * Among all Built models, LightGBM model is giving Highest Accuracy of 98% on Test data and Highest AUC score of 99%.
   * So, LightGBM is the most Optimal model in my case.

## Model Validation:
   * Model is validated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall and AUC score.
